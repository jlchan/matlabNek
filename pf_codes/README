This directory contains a collection of matlab codes for solving either 
pure convection or convection/diffusion on [-1,1]^2.

At present, only three convection codes are here.  (I have more,
but they're not yet cleaned up.)

To run those that are here, type in matlab:

N=33; c_acc         % explicit convection, with "accurate" start up
N=33; cfast         % same as above, but simple start-up
N=33; conv_diff     % same as above, + implicit diffusion
N=33; cd_overint    % same as above, with dealiased convection

for polynomial order N=33.  Look at the source for these driver 
codes to see the differences.  

The first two solve pure convection (no diffusion) with
plane rotation.

The next two solve semi-implicit convect-diffusion with a
sheared rotating velocity field. ( quiver(xx,yy,cx,cy) 
to see the field.)

The first three drivers are without dealiasing.
